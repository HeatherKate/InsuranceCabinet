									== INSURANCE CABINET ==
									
	
	Insurance Cabinet is an app meant to store insured items in one location for individuals. In the event of a catastraphic event an individual or a business can simply print everything they have insure. 
	
	I built this app using the MERN stack. 
	My pictures have been hard-coded in as I was unable to get my "upload" working during the two-week sprint. 
	
	With more time I do plan on getting an upload option and the ability to add the value of each item and have them added together on the front page. Additionally, the print option would print all the pictures associated with each page.
